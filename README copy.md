## License

This project is proprietary and for use by Eastern Samar State University only.

## Initial Flutter Setup

Run `flutter pub get` to install initial project dependencies.

## Running the App

### For Web

```bash
flutter run -d chrome --web-port 5000
```

### For Android

```bash
flutter run -d emulator-5554
```

Use the Run/Debug options in your IDE (like VS Code or Android Studio).

**Important**: Ensure your Android emulator has Google Play Services installed. When creating a new emulator, choose a system image that includes the Play Store icon.

## Firebase Setup (Backend & Database)

This project uses Firebase for authentication, database (Firestore), and storage. Follow these steps carefully:

### 1. Create Firebase Project Online

*   Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
*   Sign in with a Google account.
*   Click "Add project" or "Create a project".
*   Name the project (e.g., "ESSU Alumni Tracker"). Note the unique **Project ID** assigned (e.g., `essu-alumni-tracker-9ded3`). You will need this ID later.
*   Follow the on-screen steps to complete project creation.

### 2. Install Firebase Tools & FlutterFire CLI

If you haven't already, install the necessary command-line tools globally:

```bash
npm install -g firebase-tools
dart pub global activate flutterfire_cli
```

*(**Note:** If you get a PATH warning after installing `flutterfire_cli`, you may need to add the Dart Pub cache bin directory (e.g., `C:\Users\<YourUsername>\AppData\Local\Pub\Cache\bin` on Windows) to your system's PATH environment variable and restart your terminal/IDE.)*

### 3. Login to Firebase via CLI

Authenticate the Firebase CLI with the Google account used in Step 1:

```bash
firebase login
```

Follow the browser prompts to log in and grant permissions.

### 4. Configure Firebase in Flutter Project

Navigate to your Flutter project's root directory in the terminal and run the following command. Replace `YOUR_PROJECT_ID` with the actual Project ID from Step 1:

```bash
# Example using the ID from the log:
flutterfire configure --project=essu-alumni-tracker-9ded3
```

This command will:
*   Communicate with your Firebase project online.
*   Register apps for different platforms (Android, iOS, Web, macOS) within your Firebase project if they don't already exist.
*   Generate the crucial configuration file `lib/firebase_options.dart`.

### 5. Add Firebase Dependencies to `pubspec.yaml`

Ensure the following Firebase packages (or compatible newer versions) are listed under the `dependencies:` section in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  # --- Firebase Packages ---
  firebase_core: ^2.30.0 # Check for latest version
  firebase_auth: ^4.19.0
  cloud_firestore: ^4.16.0
  firebase_storage: ^11.7.0
  firebase_app_check: ^0.2.1+14
  # --- Other Dependencies ---
  # Add any other dependencies your project needs here
  cupertino_icons: ^1.0.8
  # ... etc
```

After adding/updating these lines, save `pubspec.yaml` and run `flutter pub get` in your terminal.

### 6. Android Setup

#### 6.1 Verify build.gradle.kts
Make sure you're using Kotlin DSL (`build.gradle.kts`) instead of Groovy (`build.gradle`). If both exist, delete the `build.gradle` file.

Your `android/app/build.gradle.kts` should include:
```kotlin
plugins {
    id("com.android.application")
    id("com.google.gms.google-services")
    id("kotlin-android")
    id("dev.flutter.flutter-gradle-plugin")
}
```

#### 6.2 Get SHA Certificate Fingerprint
To get the SHA-256 certificate fingerprint needed for App Check:

1. Navigate to your project's android folder:
```bash
cd android
```

2. Run the signing report command:
```bash
./gradlew signingReport    # On Unix/Mac
gradlew signingReport      # On Windows
```

3. Copy the SHA-256 fingerprint (without colons) from the output.

### 7. Firebase App Check Setup

1. Go to Firebase Console > App Check
2. Click "Get Started"
3. For your Android app:
   - Select "Play Integrity" as the provider
   - Paste your SHA-256 fingerprint
   - Enable debug token for development
4. Save the configuration

### 8. Troubleshooting Firebase Connection

If you encounter connection issues:

1. Verify Google Play Services:
   - Ensure your emulator has Google Play Services installed
   - Open Play Store in the emulator to verify it works
   - Check if Google Play Services is up to date

2. Check Network:
   - Verify internet connection in the emulator
   - Try opening a website in the emulator's browser

3. Verify Configuration:
   - Ensure `google-services.json` is in `android/app/`
   - Check package name matches in Firebase Console
   - Verify App Check is properly configured

4. Common Issues:
   - "Network error": Check emulator's internet connection
   - "App Check error": Verify SHA-256 fingerprint in Firebase Console
   - "Unimplemented error": Make sure all Firebase dependencies are up to date

### 9. Firebase Emulator Setup

For local development, you can use Firebase Emulator Suite. First, install Java 11 or later:

1. Download OpenJDK 11 (Temurin) from:
   https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/?version=11&os=windows&arch=x64&package=jdk

2. Set JAVA_HOME environment variable:
   - Add to System Variables: `JAVA_HOME = C:\Path\To\Your\JDK`
   - Add to PATH: `%JAVA_HOME%\bin`

3. Start emulators:
```bash
firebase emulators:start
```

### 10. Enable Firebase Services in Console

Go back to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) for your project:

*   In the left-hand menu under **Build**:
    *   Click **Authentication**: Click "Get started" and enable the sign-in methods you plan to use (e.g., Email/Password).
    *   Click **Firestore Database**: Click "Create database", choose **Start in production mode** (important for security rules), select a server location (choose one near your target users), and click "Enable".
    *   Click **Storage**: Click "Get started", follow the prompts (accepting default security rules is okay *temporarily* for development, but **you must secure them before launch**), and preferably choose the same server location as Firestore.

### 11. Platform-Specific Configuration Files (Verify)

The `flutterfire configure` command *should* handle adding the necessary platform-specific configuration files automatically. However, it's good practice to verify they exist:

*   **Android:** Check for `android/app/google-services.json`.
*   **iOS:** Check for `ios/Runner/GoogleService-Info.plist`.

If these files are missing after running `flutterfire configure`, you might need to download them manually from the Firebase project settings (Project Overview gear icon > Project settings > Your apps section > select the platform) and place them in the correct directories as listed above.

### 12. Set Up Firestore Security Rules

In the Firebase Console, go to Firestore Database > Rules tab and set up appropriate security rules. Alternatively, you can define them in `firestore.rules` in your project root and deploy them using the Firebase CLI.

#### Security Rules File Structure:

Create a file named `firestore.rules` in your project root with the following structure:

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // User profile rules
    match /users/{userId} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null;
      allow update: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
      allow create: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
    
    // User settings rules
    match /user_settings/{userId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
      allow read: if request.auth != null;
    }
    
    // Add rules for other collections as needed
    // match /events/{eventId} { ... }
    // match /jobs/{jobId} { ... }
  }
}
```

#### Deploy Security Rules:

After defining your rules, deploy them using the Firebase CLI:

```bash
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
```

#### Common Security Rule Patterns:

1. **Admin Check Function**:
   ```javascript
   function isAdmin() {
     return get(/databases/$(database)/documents/users/$(request.auth.uid)).data.role == "admin";
   }
   ```

2. **Allow own data access**:
   ```javascript
   allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
   ```

3. **Admin-only operations**:
   ```javascript
   allow create, update, delete: if request.auth != null && isAdmin();
   ```

4. **Read for all authenticated users, write for admins**:
   ```javascript
   allow read: if request.auth != null;
   allow write: if request.auth != null && isAdmin();
   ```

When modifying rules:
1. Edit the `firestore.rules` file
2. Test locally if possible
3. Deploy with `firebase deploy --only firestore:rules`
4. Verify changes in the Firebase Console (Firestore Database > Rules tab)

### 12.1. Set Up Firestore Indexes for Complex Queries

For complex queries that filter on multiple fields or use ordering, Firestore requires composite indexes. Create a file named `firestore.indexes.json` in your project root:

```json
{
  "indexes": [
    {
      "collectionGroup": "jobs",
      "queryScope": "COLLECTION",
      "fields": [
        { "fieldPath": "status", "order": "ASCENDING" },
        { "fieldPath": "postedDate", "order": "DESCENDING" }
      ]
    },
    {
      "collectionGroup": "jobs",
      "queryScope": "COLLECTION",
      "fields": [
        { "fieldPath": "type", "order": "ASCENDING" },
        { "fieldPath": "postedDate", "order": "DESCENDING" }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "fieldOverrides": []
}
```

Deploy these indexes using:

```bash
firebase deploy --only firestore:indexes
```

When you see the error message "The query requires an index", you can:
1. Click the provided link in the error message
2. Or manually create the index in Firebase Console (Firestore Database > Indexes > Composite)
3. Or add the index configuration to `firestore.indexes.json` and deploy it

Note that composite indexes can take a few minutes to build after deployment.

#### Common Index Patterns:

1. **Filter + Order**:
   ```json
   {
     "collectionGroup": "collection_name",
     "fields": [
       { "fieldPath": "filter_field", "order": "ASCENDING" },
       { "fieldPath": "order_field", "order": "DESCENDING" }
     ]
   }
   ```

2. **Multiple Filters + Order**:
   ```json
   {
     "collectionGroup": "collection_name",
     "fields": [
       { "fieldPath": "filter1", "order": "ASCENDING" },
       { "fieldPath": "filter2", "order": "ASCENDING" },
       { "fieldPath": "order_field", "order": "DESCENDING" }
     ]
   }
   ```

### 13. Firestore Database Schema

The application uses the following Firestore collections and document structure:

#### Users Collection
- **Document ID**: Firebase Auth UID (automatically generated)
- **Fields**:
  - `email`: String (from Firebase Auth)
  - `firstName`: String
  - `lastName`: String
  - `batchYear`: Integer
  - `course`: String
  - `studentId`: String (unique)
  - `profileImageUrl`: String (optional)
  - `currentOccupation`: String (optional)
  - `company`: String (optional)
  - `location`: String (optional)
  - `bio`: String (optional)
  - `role`: String (e.g., "admin", "moderator", "alumni")
  - `isActive`: Boolean (default: true)
  - `createdAt`: Timestamp (server-generated)
  - `updatedAt`: Timestamp (server-generated)
  - `lastLogin`: Timestamp (optional)

#### Other Collections
- **Events Collection**: For storing event information
- **Event_Attendees Collection**: For tracking event attendance
- **Jobs Collection**: For job postings
- **Job_Applications Collection**: For tracking job applications
- **News Collection**: For news articles
- **News_Interactions Collection**: For tracking user interactions with news
- **User_Settings Collection**: For user preferences
- **User_Connections Collection**: For managing user connections
- **Notifications Collection**: For storing user notifications

For the complete schema, refer to `database_schema.txt` in the project root.

### 14. Project Ownership Transfer

To transfer project ownership to another Google account:

1. Go to the Firebase Console for your project
2. Click the gear icon (Project settings) next to "Project Overview"
3. Go to the "Users and permissions" tab
4. Click "Add member"
5. Enter the email address of the new owner
6. Select "Owner" role
7. Click "Add"
8. The new owner will receive an email invitation to accept
9. Once accepted, the original owner can optionally remove themselves

### 15. Next Steps

### for Emulating firebase

https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/?version=11&os=windows&arch=x64&package=jdk
put the java_home thing, and also on path

### for building an APK Build

flutter build apk --release

flutter build apk --split-per-abi --release

### for building WEB

flutter build web --release

only do this first time i think : firebase init hosting then put build/web

For Firebase hosting, you should use the build/web directory as your public directory. This is where Flutter builds the compiled web app files.
When running firebase init hosting, here are the options you should select:
For the question about the public directory, enter: build/web
Configure as a single-page app? Answer y (yes)
Set up automatic builds and deploys with GitHub? Answer as per your preference, but typically n (no) is fine for most cases
Overwrite existing files? Answer n (no) to avoid overwriting your index.html
This setup will tell Firebase hosting to serve your Flutter web app from the build/web directory, which is the standard output location when you run flutter build web.

firebase deploy --only hosting

Hosting URL: https://essu-alumni-tracker-9ded3.web.app
